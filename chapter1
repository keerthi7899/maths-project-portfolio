<h1>Chapter 1 : Description of Data</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In everyday life we collect a lot of information such as marks obtained by students, 
temperature of a city, rainfall, heights and weights of people etc.  
Such information is called <b>data</b>.  
The branch of mathematics which deals with the collection, presentation, analysis and 
interpretation of data is called <b>Statistics</b>.
</p>

<h2>Objectives of Studying Data</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To understand large amounts of information easily.</li>
    <li>To compare different sets of information.</li>
    <li>To make predictions and proper decisions.</li>
    <li>To represent information in an organized manner.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Data</h2>
<p>Data can be classified into two main types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Primary Data:</b> Data collected directly by the investigator through survey, experiment or observation.</li>
    <li><b>Secondary Data:</b> Data collected from books, journals, newspapers, websites, reports and other sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Variables</h2>
<p>
A variable is a quantity which can change its value.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Discrete Variable:</b> Takes specific fixed values such as number of students in a class.</li>
    <li><b>Continuous Variable:</b> Can take any value such as height, weight, temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mean</h2>
<p>
Mean is the average value of the observations.
</p>
<div class="formula">Mean = (Sum of all observations) ÷ (Total number of observations)</div>

<h2>Weighted Mean</h2>
<p>
When some values are more important than others, weights are assigned and the average obtained is called weighted mean.
</p>
<div class="formula">Weighted Mean = Σ(wx) ÷ Σw</div>

<h2>Median</h2>
<p>
Median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.  
If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
</p>

<h2>Mode</h2>
<p>
Mode is the observation which occurs the maximum number of times in the data.
</p>

<h2>Quartiles</h2>
<p>
Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.  
They are Q1 (first quartile), Q2 (median) and Q3 (third quartile).
</p>

<h2>Variance</h2>
<p>
Variance measures the dispersion or spread of data from its mean.  
A larger variance shows greater spread in the data.
</p>

<h2>Coefficient of Variation</h2>
<p>
It helps in comparing the variability of two or more data sets.
</p>
<div class="formula">Coefficient of Variation = (Standard Deviation ÷ Mean) × 100</div>

<h2>Histogram</h2>
<p>
A histogram is a graphical representation of a frequency distribution using rectangular bars.
It helps in understanding the shape and spread of the data.
</p>

<h2>Box Plot</h2>
<p>
A box plot represents the five number summary of the data:
minimum value, Q1, median, Q3 and maximum value.
It helps in identifying the spread and skewness of data.
</p>

<h2>Skewness</h2>
<p>
Skewness describes the symmetry of a distribution.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Positive Skewness:</b> Tail of the distribution is towards the right.</li>
    <li><b>Negative Skewness:</b> Tail of the distribution is towards the left.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The study of data helps us to understand information scientifically and make accurate decisions.  
Measures like mean, median, mode and graphical tools such as histogram and box plot play an 
important role in analyzing real life situations.
